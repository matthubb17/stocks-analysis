# Stocks Analysis for Steve

## Overview of Project: 

#### Our good friend, Steve, just graduated with a finance degree and his parents have become his first client. Steve's parents are passionate about green energy any have invested in one green energy stock, DAQO New Energy Corp, despite theier minimal knowledge about this subject.  The purpose of this project was to analyze the stocks data for Steve and to help him determine if it makes more sense for him to encourage his parents to diversify their funds in other stocks besides DAQO. In this project I used VBA to help automate some tasks within excel to help Steve better analyze these stocks. The work that we did in VBA allows Steve to reuse it with any stock and reduces the risk of error. In addition to helping Steve by building out a way to analyze stocks within excel using VBA, I also took a final step by refactoring the code in order to run the VBA script more efficiently and quicker.

## Results:

![2017 All Stocks](https://github.com/matthubb17/stocks-analysis/blob/main/Resources/2017%20All%20Stocks.png?raw=true) ![2017 All Stocks](https://github.com/matthubb17/stocks-analysis/blob/main/Resources/2018%20All%20Stocks.png?raw=true)

##### You can see above that my stocks analysis for both 2017 and 2018 show the volatility of these green energy stocks. The imagas above illustrate 12 individual stocks performances for both 2017 and 2018. When looking at the data more closely there does not seem to be a direct relationship between the "Total Daily Volume" of each stock and the "Return" that we see for each year. This is something that Steve should notify his parents about as this seemed to be something that they believed was correlated.
