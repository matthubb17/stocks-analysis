# Stocks Analysis for Steve

## Overview of Project: 

#### Our good friend, Steve, just graduated with a finance degree and his parents have become his first client. Steve's parents are passionate about green energy any have invested in one green energy stock, DAQO New Energy Corp, despite theier minimal knowledge about this subject.  The purpose of this project was to analyze the stocks data for Steve and to help him determine if it makes more sense for him to encourage his parents to diversify their funds in other stocks besides DAQO. In this project I used VBA to help automate some tasks within excel to help Steve better analyze these stocks. The work that we did in VBA allows Steve to reuse it with any stock and reduces the risk of error.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

#### One challenge that had to be navigated throughout this project was the format of the dates within the original dataset. By having to convert the format of the dates there was an additional step needed to be taken prior to analyzing the data. One other challenge throughout this project occurred when entering various formulas within excel. I was able to alleviate most of the formula issues by properly using absolute references when needed in order to have an easier time with the formulas required for analysis.
